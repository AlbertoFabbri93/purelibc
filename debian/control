Architecture: any

Depends: purelibc1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Overlay library for glibc that allows system call capturing - development
 Pure_libc converts glibc from a libc+system interfacing library into a
 libc-only library. A process can trace the system call generated by itself
 by purelibc. Pure_libc is not complete yet. Stdio has been implemented onto
 the fopencookie call. Due to current limitations of fopencookie, freopen may
 not work properly when reopening files different from std{in,out,err}.
 .
 This package contains the development files for libvdestack
