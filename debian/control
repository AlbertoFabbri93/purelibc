Description: An overlay library for glibc that allows system call capturing
 Pure_libc converts glibc from a libc+system interfacing library into a libc-only 
 library. A process can trace the system call generated by itself by purelibc. Pure_libc 
 is not complete yet. Stdio has been implemented onto the fopencookie call. Due to 
 current limitations of fopencookie, freopen may not work properly when reopening files 
 different from std{in,out,err}.
